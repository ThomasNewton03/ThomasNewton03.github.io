# Dr. Mark McGill
I'm a Lecturer in Extended Reality (XR) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, and part of the Multimodal Interaction Group within the [GIST research section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/gist-section/). My research spans work at the intersection of XR, HCI, and the anticipated future of spatial computing, including:
* Future XR-enabled passenger experiences, as a founding part of [ERC ViAjeRo project](https://viajero-project.org/), examining key problems around motion sickness, interaction in constrained spaces, social acceptability, telepresence/communication, reality awareness and more.
* Future productivity experiences, and the benefits to mobility and ergonomics posed by XR
* The societal opportunities and challenges posed by mass adoption of XR (and in particular everyday Augmented Reality as pursued by every major tech company) around privacy, freedom of expression and more.

I'm always on the look out for promising students with intersectional interests in XR, so do drop me an email if you want to collaborate or be supervised here!
