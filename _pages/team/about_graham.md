# Dr. Graham Wilson
I'm a Research Fellow in Human-Computer Interaction and Mixed Reality, having previously worked on [ERC ViAjeRo](https://viajero-project.org/) and in digital health at University of Strathclyde. My research in particular focuses on the psychological, cognitive and physical benefits/risks of long-term usage of virtual, mixed and augmented reality media.
