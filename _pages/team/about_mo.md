# Prof. Mohamed Khamis
I am a Reader (Associate Professor) in Human-centered Security at the University of Glasgow's School of Computing Science. I lead the [SIRIUS lab](https://mkhamis.github.io/mkhamis/), which conducts research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, privacy and security. I regularly publish in HCI, usable security, privacy and eye tracking in venues like CHI, USENIX Security, IMWUT. See [my website](http://www.mkhamis.com/) for more details.
