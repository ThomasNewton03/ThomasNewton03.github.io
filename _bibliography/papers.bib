  abstract = {Immersive technologies allow us to personalize our reality while traveling; however, widespread adoption remains limited. This study investigates the challenges of adopting immersive devices in transit, particularly when passengers encounter               asymmetric experiences               using disparate devices. These situations arise as co-located passengers adopt devices with varying levels of immersion, environmental information, and interactive capabilities. Using an enactment methodology in a transit scenario involving disparate devices, our study (N=21) reveals that asymmetric passenger experiences create a sense of disconnection among passengers, especially with varying device immersion capabilities. When interactions require more than a basic response, for example complex verbal exchanges relying on social cues like gaze, adoption is further hindered. The incorporation of cues from reality addresses safety concerns but requires further refinement to support interactions that require complex or extended user involvement. This research advances the understanding of asymmetric passenger dynamics, contributing to the design of immersive technologies for transit settings.},

These headsets will allow passengers to break free from the restraints of physical displays placed in constrained environments such as cars, trains and planes. Moreover, they have the potential to allow passengers to make better use of their time by making travel more productive and enjoyable, supporting both privacy and immersion. However, there are significant barriers to headset usage by passengers in transit contexts. These barriers range from impediments that would entirely prevent safe usage and function (e.g. motion sickness) to those that might impair their adoption (e.g. social acceptability). We identify the key challenges that need to be overcome and discuss the necessary resolutions and research required to facilitate adoption and realize the potential advantages of using mixed reality headsets in transit.},
